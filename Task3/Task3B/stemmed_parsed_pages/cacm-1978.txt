the us of interact graphic to solv numer problem with
the advent of on line time share comput system and
graphic termin we have avail a new dimens in numer
problem solv capabl rather than simpli us the new power
to achiev fast turnaround we can develop interact routin which
ar easi to us and also take advantag of the
insight and visual capabl of the human problem solver sever
on line system for gener purpos mathemat problem solv have
alreadi been implement as well as some special purpos system
for solv problem in a particular area such as ordinari
differenti equat the advantag of restrict the problem area is
that the interfac with a user can be greatli simplifi
in thi paper we discuss some of the advantag accru
by such system and design consider for interact routin furthermor
an implement of an on line least squar data fit
