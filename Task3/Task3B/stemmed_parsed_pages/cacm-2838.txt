analysi of an algorithm for real time garbag collect a
real time garbag collect system avoid suspend the oper of
a list processor for the long time that garbag collect
normal requir by perform garbag collect on a second processor
in parallel with list process oper or on a singl
processor time share with them algorithm for recov discard list
structur in thi manner ar present and analyz to determin
suffici condit under which the list processor never need to
wait on the collector these techniqu ar shown to requir
at most twice as much process power as regular garbag
collector if thei ar us effici the averag behavior of
the program
