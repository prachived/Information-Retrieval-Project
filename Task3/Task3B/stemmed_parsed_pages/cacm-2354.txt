implement clenshaw curti quadratur ii comput the cosin transform in
a companion paper to thi i methodolog and experi the
automat clenshaw curti quadratur scheme wa describ and how each
quadratur formula us in the scheme requir a cosin transform
of the integrand valu wa shown the high cost of
these cosin transform ha been a seriou drawback in us
clenshaw curti quadratur two other problem relat to the cosin
transform have also been troubl some first the convent comput
of the cosin transform by recurr relat is numer unstabl
particularli at the low frequenc which have the largest effect
upon the integr second in case the automat scheme should
requir refin of the sam
