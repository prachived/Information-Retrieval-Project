an optim insert algorithm for on side height balanc binari
search tree an algorithm for insert an element into a
on side height balanc oshb binari search tree is present
the algorithm oper in time o log n where n
is the number of node in the tree thi repres
an improv over the best previou ly known insert algorithm
of hirschberg and kosaraju which requir time o log 2n
moreov the o log n complex is optim earlier result
have shown that delet in such a structur can also
be perform in o log n time thu the result
of thi paper give a neg answer to the question
of whether such tree should be the first exam
